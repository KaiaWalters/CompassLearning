# PRD: Learning Goals Assessment Form

## Introduction/Overview

The Learning Goals Assessment Form is a comprehensive data collection tool designed to help adult learners across various domains (academic, professional, personal development, and technical certifications) define their learning objectives and preferences. This feature serves as the foundation for an AI-powered learning platform that will generate personalized learning paths and lesson plans. The form replaces the existing church website content with a modern, user-friendly learning platform interface.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Collect comprehensive learning data from users to enable AI-powered learning path generation
2. **User Experience Goal**: Provide an intuitive, guided form experience that users can complete in 10-15 minutes
3. **Data Quality Goal**: Gather detailed information about learning goals, styles, preferences, and constraints
4. **Platform Foundation Goal**: Establish the first step in a larger learning management system
5. **Branding Goal**: Transform the church website template into a professional learning platform

## User Stories

1. **As an adult learner**, I want to complete a comprehensive assessment form so that I can receive a personalized learning plan tailored to my goals and learning style.

2. **As a professional seeking certification**, I want to specify my technical certification goals and current skill level so that the AI can create a structured study plan.

3. **As a personal development learner**, I want to indicate my learning preferences and time constraints so that the system can recommend appropriate learning resources and schedules.

4. **As a user with multiple learning goals**, I want to prioritize my objectives so that the AI can create a balanced learning path that addresses my most important needs first.

5. **As a returning user**, I want to see a summary of my learning goals and the AI's recommendations so that I understand what the system has planned for me.

- Maintain the existing typography and layout structure for consistency
- Use icons and imagery related to learning, education, and personal development

### User Experience
- Implement a step-by-step wizard with clear progress indicators
- Use conditional logic to show/hide questions based on previous responses
- Provide helpful examples and explanations for complex questions
- Include a "Save Progress" feature for longer sessions
- Design mobile-first with desktop enhancements

### Form Flow
