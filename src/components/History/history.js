The newly created church moved into 149 Roxbury Street and found a role in serving the Roxbury neighborhood through a variety of ministries and served as a home for seminary students and community activists who were drawn to its ministry. St. John St. James is a diverse church community, with members whose roots are from Barbados, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Trinidad, Canada and the United States. St. John St. James Church has roots in two Roxbury churches: St. James, organized in 1832, and St. Johnâ€™s which was created as a mission of St. James and became a parish in 1872. The following history is from the official history/profiles published by the diocese. Additional articles about the church's history are found on our ARTICLES page."
